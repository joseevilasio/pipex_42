A beautiful sunny day in the park.
The children were playing with a ball.
Suddenly, a duck appeared near the pond.
Everyone was happy to see the little duck.
The sound of laughter filled the air.
The duck swam gracefully in the water.
Birds were chirping in the trees.
A dog ran by, barking loudly.
The duck didn't seem to mind at all.
People were having picnics on the grass.
The smell of flowers was everywhere.
A little girl fed bread to the duck.
The sky was a perfect shade of blue.
Ducks are known for their distinctive quacks.
A gentle breeze made the leaves rustle.
The duckling followed its mother closely.
Children giggled as they watched the duck.
The park was a haven of peace and joy.
People smiled as they passed by the pond.
The duck, content, floated lazily in the afternoon sun.
